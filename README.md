<h1 align='center'>Hello, my name is Radek</h1>
<h2>A little bit about me</h2>
<p>
 Hi! My name is <strong>Radek</strong> and I am a young and ambitious front-end developer. Ever since I discovered coding, I fell in love with it, and since then I've been exploring the secrets of web development. I have done dozens of smaller and larger projects, I commit all my work to github. I put my best commercial and private sites in my <em>portfolio</em>. I did a couple of client work and got lots of positive feedback. I push to github my learning repo’s, which I mark private, my personal projects which range from static websites from my early days of learning the art of code to the current advanced fully responsive and interactive web apps.

    <summary>More about me</summary>
    I am a second year student of English Philology on a practical profile. What does this mean in practice? This means that I have a wide range of competences from the basics of economics through project management to communication with the client. The moment when I discovered programming was a great breakthrough in my life. That was what drove me to action, to a thirst for knowledge. I still remember the magical feeling when I wrote my first line of code. Learning programming is like a sine wave, there are ups and downs and the feeling of being overwhelmed with the current multitude of languages, frameworks and libraries to learn can give you a headache. My passion and ambition and the most important thing, the discipline itself, keep pushing me forward in my journey to becoming a front-end developer.
