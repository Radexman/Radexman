👨‍💻 Hey there! I'm Radek, a frontend developer deeply passionate about crafting robust user interfaces for websites and web apps. With a relentless drive for improvement, I'm coding every day, honing my skills and exploring new techniques to elevate my work. Currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science, I'm equally committed to academic growth and real-world application.

💻 My toolbox includes an array of skills, with expertise in React, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS. These tools empower me to bring ideas to life, creating seamless and engaging experiences for users. Alongside my academic pursuits, I thrive on the challenge of coding competitions like Frontend Mentor, where I continually push myself to learn and innovate. I also enjoy contributing to the community by providing code reviews and constructive feedback to fellow developers, fostering collaboration and growth within our ecosystem.

🎓 In addition to my academic endeavors, I actively engage in freelance web development work, delivering tailored solutions for diverse clients. As I pursue a degree in Computer Science, I am currently seeking a junior frontend developer position to further develop my skills and contribute to impactful projects.

🤝 Whether I'm crafting bespoke interfaces for individual clients or collaborating on larger-scale initiatives, my goal remains the same: to deliver excellence through code. Let's connect and build something amazing together!

🎸 Outside of coding, you can often find me shredding on my guitar, indulging in my love for heavy metal music. It's my creative outlet and a source of endless inspiration.
